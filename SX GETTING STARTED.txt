Manual Installs
===============
- Git
  https://git-scm.com/download/win

- Visual Studio

- Maya SDK
  Technically, this is not shipped standalone. Also, USD build checks for the existence of Maya.exe, but doesn't
  actually need a full Maya install to build successfully. I've packaged all the needed files here:

  \\analogfs\private\Scratch\ALANTANG\Maya2018SDK  

  Copy these locally (I'll assume c:\Maya2018SDK)

- Python 2.7.15
  https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/

  Assuming install path is c:\python27, run from CMD
    set PATH=%PATH%;c:\python27;c:\python27\scripts
    pip install PySide
    pip install PyOpenGL

- CMake 3.13
  https://cmake.org/download/

Enabling Debug Build
====================
Clone:
  https://github.com/alantang-MSFT/USD.git

Checkout "debug" branch

There is a bug in c:\python27\include\pyconfig.h that causes the linker to look for python27_d.lib. I've checked
this file in at ./sx_prereq. Copy this file to c:\python27\libs.

Then open pyconfig.h and look for this code:

  #ifdef _DEBUG
  #  define Py_DEBUG
  #endif

Comment out the Py_DEBUG define.

Finally, open ./CMakeLists.txt. At the beginning of the file is a "link_directories". Ensure the path corresponds
to the 'libs' sub-directory of your python install dir (c:\python27\libs).

Build
=====
cd <REPO_ROOT>\build_scripts
python build_usd.py -v --build-debug --maya --maya-location c:\Maya2018SDK c:\sxusd-bin

Installing the Maya Plugin
==========================
Once successfully built, binaries can be found at c:\sxusd-bin.

In this file C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\maya\2018\Maya.env, add these lines:

    MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH=c:\sxusd-bin\third_party\maya\plugin
    MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH=c:\sxusd-bin\third_party\maya\lib\usd\usdMaya\resources
    PYTHONPATH=c:\sxusd-bin\lib\python
    XBMLANGPATH=c:\sxusd-bin\third_party\maya\lib\usd\usdMaya\resources

Add the following to your system path:
  
    C:\sxusd-bin\lib
    C:\sxusd-bin\bin
    C:\sxusd-bin2\third_party\maya\lib
